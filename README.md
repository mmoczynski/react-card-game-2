This is an example of a react card game. Here are the steps to running react card game:

1. Git the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mmoczynski/react-card-game-2`
2. Change to the git repository. This can be done in Windows by executing  `cd react-card-game-2`.
3. When you are in the `react-card-game-2` directory, run `npm install`.
4. After you install the node packages, a `node_packages` folder shall appear. After this, you execute `npm start` to run the react code. In a Windows, if the chrome browser is installed, it should automatically open. This typically opens up as `localhost:3000`, but not necessarily.

The `npx create-react-app` commandment created a file named `README.md`. It was renamed to [README.old.md](README.old.md).
